Storm
======================================
Welcome to Storm! This is the little ORM that I'm creating here because IMNVHO
Laravel's model system SUCKS BALLS. I'd rather use anything else--preferably something
with type hinting and not a stupid little abstraction layer over SQL where I'm
pretty much just calling ->where() instead of writing "WHERE".

I've affectionately--and hopefully ironically--decided to go with the name Storm
which stands for Sheldon's Trash ORM. Most projects like this are trash, but I am
not at a point in my life where I have the emotional stability to attempt to put up with
what Laravel has to offer.

Design
======================================
Real classes, real properties, no magic, real SQL.
